# RottenTomatoes

Rotten Tomatoes API Exercise
----

> Challenge: Consume an API of your choice or the Rotten Tomatoes and incorporate some user interaction.

> The purpose of this challenge is to give us an opportunity to see the way you think, the tools you use, your code style, your use of Github.

> This does not need to be the most complex app. Just something that shows your skills on the front-end.

> Javascript - If you know angular, Great use it. If not don't worry about it.

>You are not expected to spend more that 4 hours on this project. 


## Why I did it the way I did.

I chose to do this with PHP because I didn't want the API key to be accessible to the user in the client and felt that the API interaction would be best done that way instead of using Javascript to hit the API and fetch data. 

## Improvements that can be made
Ideally I'd like to load the detail screen for each movie dynamically so that I don't have to output a window for 
each movie directly to the DOM at runtime.

I would also like to add in a search form that sends an ajax request to allow users to search for movies and then rebuild the page.
